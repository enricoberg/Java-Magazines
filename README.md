<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

  

## Getting Started

  

  

  
  

  

### Installation

First you need to [have JAVA installed.](https://www.java.com/it/download/help/windows_manual_download.html)

If you want to simply try the application:

 - Download the JAR File
 - Download the abbonamenti.csv , utenti.csv and riviste.csv files.
 - Place all the above inside a folder and run the JAR file from a terminal:
```xml

java -jar Java-Information.jar

```

  

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

You're good to go! Follow the instructions on the app to try its functionalities.





## Edit the Project
If you want to make modifications to the app, you are free to do it by downloading the source code.
```xml

git clone https://github.com/enricoberg/Java-Magazines.git

```
The project was built with Maven and the folder structure is the following:
```markdown
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java
â”‚   â”‚   |	â”œâ”€â”€ org.example
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	â”œâ”€â”€controllers
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Controller.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Query.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	â”œâ”€â”€models
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Abbonamento.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Utente.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Rivista.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€ReadAbbonamento.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€ReadUtente.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€ReadRivista.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Database.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	â”œâ”€â”€utilities
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	|	â”œâ”€â”€Utilities.java
â”‚   â”‚   |	|	â”œâ”€â”€Main.java
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ abbonamenti.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utenti.csv
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ riviste.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
```
The entry point of the app is Main.java.
Data is stored in the CSV in the resources folder.
Java classes are grouped in folders separating Models and Controllers, plus an extra class Utilities for data validation.
pom.xml is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.

### Building
To compile and run the application you need an IDE, I personally use [IntelliJ IDEA.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows)
To import a Maven project from IntelliJ you can follow [this detailed guide.](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tutorials/working-with-maven/importing-a-project/)
To create the JAR file from within the project,
```xml
File > Project Structure>Artifacts > Add a new one (+)
```
```xml
JAR > From modules with dependencies
```
```xml
Select the Main class as entry point for the app and Apply
```
Now go to 
```xml
File > Build > Build Artifacts... > Build
```
And the JAR file will be exported in the selected folder. ðŸŽ‰
Remember to add the CSV to the folder in which you'll use the JAR ðŸ˜Š
